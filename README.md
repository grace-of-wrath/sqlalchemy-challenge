# sqlalchemy-challenge
This challenge has allowed me to demonstrate my ability to analyze and explore data using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I retrieved data to create key visualizations that provide insight on climate data. I also created a Flask app to retrieve and display data from the climate database.
